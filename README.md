# Description

The sector you're in has a limit on the amount of ships currently in the sector.
Traders by default are also included in this limit, and are having to wait at the door if there are already too many ships in the sector.
When you spend a long time in a sector, the random ships flying around will hit this limit, and it will stop traders being able to come into the sector entirely.

This mod allows traders to bypass this limit, and you'll find trade in your sector is increased as a result of traders no longer having to wait to enter the sector.

# Installing
Simply grab the .dll from the release and stick it into steam\steamapps\common\Star Valor\BepInEx\plugins folder. You'll have to install BepInEx first if you haven't already though.
